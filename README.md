# SETUP
=======
1. make sure you have python and pip3 installed
2. if you dont have virtualenv installed install it using pip3 install virtualenv
3. create a virtual environment using virtualenv env
4. to run our project in a virtual environment use "source env/scripts/activate" on windows. "source env/bin/activate" on mac/linux
5. while in environment mode, install flask and flask-sqlalchemy using pip3 "pip3 install flask flask-sqlalchemy"

If you have trouble running the code; instead of running with python try doing 'flask run' or 'flask --app <app_name> run'
Do this only after trying to run the code on python and failing.
